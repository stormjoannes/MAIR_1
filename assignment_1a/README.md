# Methods in AI Research Assignment 1
This repository contains the code for the first assignment of the Methods in AI Research course at Utrecht University. The assignment consists of implementing a simple neural network from scratch and training it on a dialoge dataset.\
It contains the two rule based baseline models in file `baselines.py`.
The keywords for these baselines are located in `keywords.json`.

The machine learning models used are:
- A Feed-forward Neural Betwork in file `FNN.py`
- A Support Vector Machine in file `SVM.py`
- A Decision Tree Classifier in file `DTC.py`

Functions used by multiple files are located in `utils.py`.

# Usage
To get results from the models simply run the dedicated file.
These files should completely run without any additional input.

Normally you would't add data files to your github, but since this simplifies the process of running the code we have included the dataset in the `data` folder.
